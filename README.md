# Personal Website

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! This project was built entirely on React and recently underwent significant updates. The website is fully responsive and mobile-compatible, and consists of two pages and a card component that allows visitors to view the details of each project.

## Project Showcase

The site showcases a diverse range of projects, each representing a unique challenge and solution. These additions provide insight into my technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills. Each project is presented with a card component for an easy-to-understand, detailed view.

## Design and Navigation

The website has a fresh, contemporary design aimed at enhancing user interaction and improving functionality. As part of the recent updates, I've worked on improving the overall navigation of the website, leveraging the power of React-router-dom and React Statehooks to ensure a seamless and engaging browsing experience.
