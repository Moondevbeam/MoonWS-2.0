          Hello, everyone! My name is Matthew, and I hail from the beautiful country of Italy. After completing high school, I discovered my passion for various tech-related fields, including coding, video games, hardware, and computers.

        <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
          My journey in the world of coding began as a self-taught enthusiast, delving into online resources and tutorials. Eager to expand my knowledge and skills, I enrolled in a web development course on Udemy, which provided a solid foundation for my learning. Since then, I have continuously honed my abilities and explored new concepts, resulting in the development of a diverse portfolio and a range of projects showcased on my website.

        <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
          Currently, my specialization lies in Front-End Development, with a particular focus on utilizing React. I'm also in the process of expanding my skill set by learning Next.js, a framework that enables server-rendered React applications. Embracing modern web technologies and staying up to date with industry trends is an essential part of my professional growth.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
          As I embark on my career journey, my immediate goal is to secure a position in the field of web development, preferably in a fully remote capacity, focusing on Front-End development. Looking further ahead, I aspire to become an SEO specialist, combining my technical skills with an in-depth understanding of search engine optimization. Ultimately, my aim is to evolve into a seasoned Front-End Developer, taking on challenging projects and contributing to the ever-evolving web development landscape.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-7">
          Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and potential collaborators in this exciting industry.
